# discourse-custom-knowledge-explorer
Theme component that makes customisations to Discourse's Knowledge Explorer plugin. basically simplifies the interface

- removes sidebar
- moves list of tags to grid layout underneath search bar
- completely removes categories selectors
- hide 'author' on topics, link to 'continue this discussion', socials links
- main searchbar and tag box is vertically centred in viewport. unfiltered list is only visible if you scroll down
